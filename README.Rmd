# algocompsynth

<!-- badges: start -->
[![Lifecycle: experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)](https://www.tidyverse.org/lifecycle/#experimental)
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `algocompsynth` is to provide functions for algorithmic music
composition and digital sound synthesis in R. `algocompsynth` will extend
the packages described in 
[Sueur, Jérôme (2018), _Sound Analysis and Synthesis with R_](https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319776453) with functions to access
GPUs via CUDA and OpenCL, functions for multi-core parallel processing and
functions for algorithmic composition.

## Installation

You can install `algocompsynth` from
[GitHub](https://znmeb.github.io/algocompsynth) with:

``` r
remotes::install_.packages_github("znmeb/algocompsynth")
```
