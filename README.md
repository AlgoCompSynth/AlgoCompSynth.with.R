<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `algocompsynth` is to provide functions for algorithmic
music composition and digital sound synthesis in R. The basic libraries
are already there; see [Sueur, Jérôme (2018), *Sound Analysis and
Synthesis with R*](https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319776453).
`algocompsynth` will extend the packages described there will functions
to access GPUs via CUDA and OpenCL, functions for multicore parallel
processing and functions for algorithmic composition.

## Installation

You can install `algocompsynth` from
[GitHub](https://znmeb.github.io/algocompsynth) with:

``` r
remotes::install_.packages_github("znmeb/algocompsynth")
```
